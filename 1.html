     worked on HTML & CSS. We know you must be dying to make some super cool stuff.
     But first try to make this simple UI design.</p><br><br>
     <p>Take a look at this screen:</p>
     <div class="code-container">
         <input type="number" class="code" min="0" max="9" required placeholder="0">
         <input type="number" class="code" min="0" max="9" required placeholder="0">
         <input type="number" class="code" min="0" max="9" required placeholder="0">
         <input type="number" class="code" min="0" max="9" required placeholder="0">
         <input type="number" class="code" min="0" max="9" required placeholder="0">
         <input type="number" class="code" min="0" max="9" required placeholder="0">
